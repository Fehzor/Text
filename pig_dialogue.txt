Lions and tigers! Forget the bears, they do their own thing.
Stupid cats thought they could get a hold of the animal kingdom.
We convinced the lions to focus on their strength, which of course was strength.
Leave the complexities of societal control to us.
Is there a flaw in the lion's lifestyles? They did their part. Great sacrifices!
Why not let yourself pleasantly rot in luxury? To what further end must you exist towards?
You may judge me for eating sausages. That is perfectly in your rights.
I'm a pig. I consume other pigs...
Hmmm? Oh, I have no counterarguments. I'm a sinful swine and happily so.
A wonderful day to oink.
Pity about your condition, being human and all.
I've spent little time pondering your nobility just as they have towards us.
Fear the nobles? The nobles are apathetic to us. Pray to bask in the blind spot of God's sight.
Image is crucial to politics! Here, help yourself to a sausage.
Pigs are intelligent, jolly about the way of things, and comforting. We can't have sticks in the mud, you know. Here, more sausage.
So pigs with a disposition towards other ways of thought, well....Want to try some bacon next?
