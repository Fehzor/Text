To think fast in a body that can't act on it. We're prisoners. We've always been prisoners.
You wonder if I envy you humans but who wants to think at such a sudden pace?
The power to act on impulses and thoughtless thoughts. You humans are chaotic.
I've seen what humans do to turtles. Weird.
Oh, don't think I'm upset or anything. If there's one thing we animals understand it's the circle of life.
Humans sound like they need a reminder every once in a while. You call it an apocalypse.

Recently my thoughts have turned to us becoming flying warships.
I think of these things but then I wonder, for what purpose?
I don't want to rule anyone or change anything. I want to live and be safe.
I eat leaves! I think about leaves! I'm working on lucid dreaming about them too.
Then I won't have to leave my shell.
I've accomplished my dream...a dream about dreaming of leaves. WHAT WAS THAT?
Didn't you hear a crunch? An unjustified rustling? I confess! I've dabbled in tulpas.
